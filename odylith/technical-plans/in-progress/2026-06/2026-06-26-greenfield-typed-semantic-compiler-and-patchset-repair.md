Goal: Re-architect confirmed greenfield create around a typed, host-reasoned
semantic compiler and bounded semantic repair loop so Odylith can write
complete, premium-quality project and governance artifacts for arbitrary
domains without regex towers, rendered-string repair, domain-specific platform
vocabulary, or degraded packages.

## Architecture

- Compile the accepted Product Intent Confirmation into a lossless
  `ConfirmedIntentIR` with section IDs, source spans, content hash, and
  provenance.
- Ask host reasoning to build `SemanticModelIR` for ambiguous human meaning:
  actors, actions, objects, state, systems, first-path events, proof
  obligations, risks, assumptions, deferred scope, decision ledger entries, and
  rejected interpretations.
- Deterministically project `SemanticModelIR` into `ArtifactPlanIR` for Radar,
  Registry, Atlas, Compass, project brief, release proof, and operator next
  steps. Renderers must receive only sanctioned projection fields for their own
  surface.
- Render the `ArtifactDraftSet`, then run deterministic validators and typed
  PM, architect, engineer, and domain-expert lenses into a `ReviewReport`.
- On repairable final-gate failure, request a formal `PatchSet` against
  `SemanticModelIR` or `ArtifactPlanIR`, rerender only affected projections, and
  rerun the same gates before any governed write.
- Keep fail-closed transaction custody in Odylith: schema validation,
  projection isolation, artifact-size guards, grammar/copy guards,
  non-repetition guards, traceability guards, timing budgets, rollback, and
  final source-truth commit.

## Latency Budget

- Standard path: under 60 seconds, no host repair needed.
- Rescue path: up to 90 seconds only when a final semantic or quality gate
  fails and a targeted host-model semantic or plan patch can likely fix it.
- Premium/deep repair and CI simulation: 120 seconds only when explicitly
  selected. This is not the normal operator path.

## Non-Goals

- Do not hand-fix generated consumer project repos.
- Do not weaken final gates to make confirmed create pass.
- Do not make rendered Markdown, Radar prose, Registry prose, Atlas labels, or
  Compass strings the repair target.
- Do not add project/domain-specific platform terms except isolated test
  fixtures.
- Do not grow regex/template towers as the semantic repair strategy. Regex may
  support mechanical parsing and tokenization only behind named owners.

## Related Bugs

- [CB-207](../../../casebook/bugs/2026-06-26-greenfield-post-confirm-package-repair-repeats-risk-prose-across-surfaces.md)
  tracks the repeated parent-risk projection failure fixed by moving child risk
  projection into semantic workstream ownership.
- [CB-208](../../../casebook/bugs/2026-06-26-greenfield-post-confirm-repair-routing-remains-stringly-typed-instead-of-semanti.md)
  tracks the remaining architecture defect: rescue still needs typed findings
  and semantic or plan patches instead of English issue-substring routing and
  rendered-prose mutation.

## Implementation Slices

- [ ] Define `ConfirmedIntentIR`, `SemanticModelIR`, `ArtifactPlanIR`,
      `ArtifactDraftSet`, `ReviewReport`, and `PatchSet` schemas with source
      provenance and stable IDs.
- [ ] Convert final package validators to emit typed finding codes, source-map
      targets, semantic node IDs, projection IDs, severity, and repairability.
- [ ] Replace post-confirm issue-substring routing with typed finding routing.
- [ ] Replace rendered-prose package repair with semantic or plan patch
      application and impacted-projection rerender.
- [ ] Add context-starved renderer contracts so Radar, Registry, Atlas,
      Compass, release proof, and next steps cannot cross-contaminate.
- [ ] Add high-variance simulation fixtures and artifact-quality scoring across
      PM, architect, engineer, and domain-expert lenses.
- [ ] Add standard/rescue latency proof and temp-repo pruning proof for the
      recursive simulation loop.

## Risks & Mitigations

- [ ] Risk: Host reasoning improves semantic quality but makes normal creates
      slower or nondeterministic.
  - [ ] Mitigation: Keep one standard semantic compiler call, use deterministic
        planning/rendering/custody, and reserve host repair for final-gate rescue.
- [ ] Risk: Typed repair becomes another wrapper around rendered text.
  - [ ] Mitigation: Tests must fail if a repair mutates rendered Markdown,
        Radar prose, Registry prose, Atlas labels, Compass entries, or release
        proof strings directly.
- [ ] Risk: Artifact lenses produce readable diagnostics but cannot drive repair.
  - [ ] Mitigation: Every lens finding must carry a finding code, semantic node
        ID, source-map target, projection ID, severity, and repairability.
- [ ] Risk: The architecture record passes while generated artifacts remain
      below the premium human bar.
  - [ ] Mitigation: Completion requires fresh high-variance end-to-end
        simulations, validators, timing evidence, and PM/architect/engineer/
        domain-expert artifact-quality reports.

## Validation

- [ ] Unit tests for semantic IR construction, ambiguity decision ledger,
      rejected interpretations, projection isolation, and source-map targets.
- [ ] Unit tests proving typed findings route repair without validator-message
      substring matching.
- [ ] Unit tests proving `PatchSet` repair applies to `SemanticModelIR` or
      `ArtifactPlanIR`, rerenders only impacted projections, and never edits
      rendered artifacts directly.
- [ ] End-to-end confirmed-create tests proving governed records are written
      after final package quality passes.
- [ ] Timing tests proving standard under 60 seconds and rescue under 90 seconds.
- [ ] Recursive high-variance simulation runs across unrelated domains with
      temp repos deleted after each run.
- [ ] Artifact QA reports for each simulation using PM, architect, engineer,
      and domain-expert gates.
